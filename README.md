# mGallery

**mGallery** is a little webapp to help you create your own online gallery as an artist who creates images, be it illustration, photographies, paintings..

In the current state it is made of some PHP scripts that generate a webpage gallery with the content supplied in a XML config file. It uses HTML, CSS, XML, Javascript and PHP. You don't need the online server to support PHP, you can generate the mGallery in your development environment and upload the result to a simple free hosting.

*App under development!*
